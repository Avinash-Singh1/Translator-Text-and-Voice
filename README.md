# Text and Voice Translate 

The Text and Voice Translate App  is a web application that combines text translation and speech recognition capabilities. Built with modern technologies like **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**, this app integrates with the **Azure/OpenAI API** for translation services and features user authentication, translation history, and speech-to-text functionality.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure Gmail-based login powered by **Clerk**.
- **Automatic Language Detection**: Automatically detects the input language for translations.
- **Debounced Input**: Optimizes API usage by waiting 5 seconds after user input before sending a request.
- **Translation History**: Displays a history of translations for easy reference.
- **Speech Recognition**: Supports voice input for translations.
- **Optimized Fonts**: Utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to load and optimize Inter, a Google Font.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, `tailwindcss-animate`
- **API Integration**: Azure/OpenAI API
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Database**: MongoDB (integrated with Azure CosmosDB)
- **Utilities**: Axios, Lodash, UUID, React-Timeago
